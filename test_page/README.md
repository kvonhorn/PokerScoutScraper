# test\_page

A copy of the main page on pokerscout.com that I use for testing.

## Downloading your own copy for testing
I am not committing the page that I downloaded to git due to a copyright claim
by pokerscout.com. If you need your own copy of the page for testing, you
should open [http://www.pokerscout.com/](http://www.pokerscout.com/) in your
browser and save the page to this directory.
